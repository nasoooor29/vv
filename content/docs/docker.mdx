# Docker Container Management

Visory provides a comprehensive interface for managing Docker containers and images across multiple Docker daemon connections.

## Overview

The Docker management feature allows you to:
- Connect to multiple Docker daemons
- View, create, and manage containers
- Monitor container statistics in real-time
- Manage Docker images

## Required Permissions

| Action | Permission |
|--------|------------|
| View containers/images | `docker_read` |
| Create containers | `docker_write` |
| Start/Stop/Restart | `docker_update` |
| Delete containers/images | `docker_delete` |

## Accessing Docker Management

Navigate to **Docker** in the sidebar (requires `docker_read` permission).

## Docker Clients

Visory supports multiple Docker daemon connections. Each client represents a connection to a Docker daemon (local or remote).

### Listing Clients

The Docker page displays all available Docker clients with their connection status.

## Container Operations

### Viewing Containers

The container grid displays all containers with:
- Container name
- Image
- Status (running, stopped, etc.)
- Created date
- Port mappings

### Container Details

Click on a container to view detailed information:
- Full container ID
- Image and command
- Environment variables
- Network settings
- Mount points
- Resource limits

### Creating a Container

1. Click **Create Container**
2. Select the Docker client
3. Choose an image from available images
4. Configure container settings:
   - Name
   - Port mappings
   - Environment variables
   - Volume mounts
5. Click **Create**

### Container Actions

| Action | Description | Permission |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Start | Start a stopped container | `docker_update` |
| Stop | Stop a running container | `docker_update` |
| Restart | Restart a container | `docker_update` |
| Delete | Remove a container | `docker_delete` |

### Viewing Logs

Click the logs icon to view container output. Logs can be:
- Streamed in real-time
- Downloaded as a file

### Container Statistics

Real-time statistics are available for running containers:
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Network I/O
- Block I/O

## Image Management

### Viewing Images

The images section displays all available Docker images with:
- Repository and tag
- Image ID
- Size
- Created date

### Deleting Images

Select an image and click **Delete** to remove it. Note that images in use by containers cannot be deleted.

## API Reference

### Docker Clients

```
GET /api/docker
```
Returns list of available Docker clients.

### Container Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/docker/:clientId/containers` | GET | List containers |
| `/api/docker/:clientId/containers/:id` | GET | Inspect container |
| `/api/docker/:clientId/containers/:id/stats` | GET | Get container stats |
| `/api/docker/:clientId/containers/:id/stats/stream` | GET | Stream stats (SSE) |
| `/api/docker/:clientId/containers/:id/logs` | GET | Get container logs |
| `/api/docker/:clientId/containers` | POST | Create container |
| `/api/docker/:clientId/containers/:id/start` | POST | Start container |
| `/api/docker/:clientId/containers/:id/stop` | POST | Stop container |
| `/api/docker/:clientId/containers/:id/restart` | POST | Restart container |
| `/api/docker/:clientId/containers/:id` | DELETE | Delete container |

### Image Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/docker/:clientId/images` | GET | List images |
| `/api/docker/:clientId/images/:id` | DELETE | Delete image |

## Container States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `created` | Container created but not started |
| `running` | Container is running |
| `paused` | Container is paused |
| `restarting` | Container is restarting |
| `removing` | Container is being removed |
| `exited` | Container has stopped |
| `dead` | Container is dead |

## Best Practices

1. **Use meaningful names**: Give containers descriptive names for easy identification
2. **Set resource limits**: Configure memory and CPU limits to prevent resource exhaustion
3. **Clean up unused images**: Regularly remove unused images to save disk space
4. **Monitor statistics**: Keep an eye on resource usage for running containers
5. **Use health checks**: Configure container health checks for reliability
