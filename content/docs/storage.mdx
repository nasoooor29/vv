    "usage_percent": 45
  }
]
```

### Get Mount Points

```
GET /api/storage/mount-points

Response:
```json
[
  {
    "path": "/",
    "device": "/dev/sda1",
    "filesystem": "ext4",
    "total": "500GB",
    "used": "225GB",
    "available": "275GB",

## Usage Indicators

The UI displays usage with color-coded indicators:

| Usage | Color | Status |

| 0-70% | Green | Normal |
| 70-85% | Yellow | Warning |
| 85-100% | Red | Critical |

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor Regularly**: Check storage usage to prevent disk full scenarios
2. **Plan Capacity**: Provision additional storage before hitting critical thresholds
3. **Clean Up**: Remove unused files, logs, and temporary data
4. **Backup Important Data**: Regularly backup data on critical mount points
